 you do not want knowledge.  You want answers. 
 You do not want to learn how things work.  You want answers. 
 You do not want to explore.  All you want to know is the answer to your damn questions. 

 Hacking is not about answers. 
 Hacking is about the path you take to find the answers. 
 If you want help, don't ask for answers, ask for a pointer to the path you need to take to find out those answers for yourself. 
 Because it is not the people with the answers that are the hackers, it is the people that are travelling along the path.
